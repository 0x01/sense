Honesty first
-------------
This is an evening project which have gotten out of hand.
It has rough edges and probably bugs but the basic machinery is in place but there is still a lot that can be done.

I find it very useful. I hope you do too.

Installation
------------

In your elasticsearch installation folder, run:

    bin/plugin -install bleskes/sense
